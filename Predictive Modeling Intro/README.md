# Predictive-Modeling-Intro
Assignments from the UT MSBA Intro to Predictive Modeling summer course

This repository includes short examples of: simple regression with one or more variables, regression with regularization, classification with logistic regression and K-Nearest Neighbors, various uses of trees (bagging, boosting, random forest), neural nets, bootstrapping, segmentation using K-means and Principal Component Analysis, Association Rule Mining, and Text Analysis with Naive Bayes.

The STA380 Book Exercises.Rmd file answers questions from An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R, Seventh Printing by James, Witten, Hastie, and Tibshirani. Supplemental questions not within the textbook are answered as well.

STA380 Homeworks 1 and 2 include exploratory analysis and insights on real-world data sets as well as applying statistical methods to solve either business problems or unique problems. These two homework assignments were done in colaboration with fellow MSBA students: Ryan Hoff, Won Lee, and Sam Malcolm.
